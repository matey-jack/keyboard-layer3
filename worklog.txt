all the base stuff should not be needed in Linux according to 



./rules/base.extras.xml:5

and there is indeed new input infrastructure in wayland called "libinput".
and probably all Gnome apps (terminal, gedit, ect.) have been recompiled to work with that
while IntelliJ still uses the old ways (likely related to all Java stuff running
under XWayland https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39197208/java-gui-support-on-wayland )

Java for Wayland is also not expected: https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2016-August/030832.html

Chrome probably uses EGL for rendering already and has no reason to switch to Wayland's libinput urgently. 
on the other hand, ChromeOS never had an Xserver and uses Wayland since a long time.
Probably prepared by the fact, that it had something like EGL from the start...

Apparently, EGL was invented for embedded devices which did not have an X-server
and used on Blackberry, Android, etc. Since it offered more direct use of GPUs
from apps, it apparently become also used on Desktop Linux and therefore part of
the migration away from X-Windows and its APIs. Both Wayland and Mir (now defunct)
use it.

So, I guess, both ChromeOS and Chrome (for being multi-platform, including Android)
have used EGL
