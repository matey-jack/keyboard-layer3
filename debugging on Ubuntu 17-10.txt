Problem:
- Layout loaded with xkbdcomp works only in IntelliJ (and possibly other Java apps), 
- it works partly in Chrome: normal letter swaps, but not AltGr and E, therefore impossible to type E, 
  since old position is now B
- doesn't w in standard terminal or GEdit at all

trying to start again from a fresh `xkbcomp $DISPLAY layout.xkb` and changing only one letter there
has the same problem: works in IntelliJ and Chrome, but not in Terminal.
