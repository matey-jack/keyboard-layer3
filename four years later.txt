working perfectly
=================

Swapped letters, including the thumb-e. Really miss all of it although I can still type quick fast on the 19th century keyboard. Probably keeping most keys on the same finger is key to keeping that flexibility!

Shifted right hand position and CAPS as Shift. Priceless! Removes so much pain. 

Left AltGr aka L3 modifier: Four pairs of parentheses on two strong fingers is awesome. One quickly forgets that < and > have been expelled from their own key.

Having / and \ on main keyboard (ex-B) make life so much easier that I don't need many L3 positions. This is because some of those (like / and *) only existed to make common bigrams (such as ~/ and \* easier to type). Now \* has both keys on Layer2 (Shift), so it is even easier to type and trivial to remember.

' without modifier is the right thing!

= on bottom row is great for typing <= and >=.

not actually changing any of the numbers and symbols on top row is also great, because I use them so rarely (but still regularly) that they would be hard to learn, but still dearly missed. Having the third layer alternative keying simply means that I can choose a keying depending whether my hands are in home-row fast-typing mode or in hovering navigate-and-edit mode.

I have much fallen in love with the emdash and the multiplication sign. Really great to have them (nevermind the standard xkb layout has them already -- with "leichter tippen" and "layer 3" you can also get them on Windows and Mac ;-))


Working well, but could be practiced more or possibly tweaked to perfection
===========================================================================

Left Hand Navigation: is great, but I don't use it enough.

French and Spanish letters: great to have them, although I need them rarely
Reaching onto the number row for ! and ? and " seems still natural to me now, so I am not thinking about replicating those keys on another layer. Especially ! and ? serve as end-of-sentence and come with a pause in typing anywhere. I will, however, rethink an alternative to " because it so often needed in programming. OTOH, with caps as shift it can be reached easily even with only the left hand (common usecase when copy-pasting string expressions with the mouse and needing to add quotes).

There are still some unused spots on L3 (and even more on Shift+L3). Maybe I could find great uses for them if I would observe myself a little more. As I have shown with the / slash: observing my own motions and what's slow brings greater insight than the key log. 

pretty quotes (left and right, as well as the German lower quote) would be nice to have, mainly for the double quote.

backtick as a live key is also useful in programming. might get rid of (or move) the dead-grave, if à and è are easy to get...

TODO: shall we have one-stroke positions for é è à (incl. É È À)? We could use the third (and shift+third) levels on e ö ä (since third+a is already taken...).
